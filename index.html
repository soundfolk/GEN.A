                as compared to
                rest of the quizzes and assignments we gave so i made this quizz site to help you all out with the most
                probable questions for the end term..</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The questions will keep getting difficult over time.(only if u can solve the easier ones)</li>
                    <li>There are no fixed questions.. you can solve as much as you want and will get the result
                        according to no. of correctly solved/no of solved</li>
                    <li>Click on "Finish" and you'll get the marks in percentage and Remarks</li>
                    <li>You can skip a question if you find it tough (you're recommended to take an SS of that to solve
                        it later)</li>
                    <li>I could have added your rank comparing with others but it's not of any use to
                        compete..
                        just
                        practise and
                        leave</li>
                    <li>The question in there are most probable to be asked in the End term math, only changing numbers
                        will do..</li>
                    <li>Suggestion.. i've made this site just as a test.. so do not go for the UI and all i didn't give
                        much time to it</li>
                    <li>Click on the option directly the answer will be submitted..</li>
